## 1. Mission and Solution Scope

- **Problem**: Brick-and-mortar retail wants to shorten checkout queues, improve stock intelligence, and reduce shrinkage without heavy infrastructure changes.
- **ShopPad Answer**: A smart shopping cart that marries IoT weight sensing (ESP32 + HX711) with a secure Node.js backend and a real-time React/TypeScript frontend. Customers scan products, monitor weight deltas in real time, and complete NFC-assisted checkout on the cart itself.
- **Value Proposition**:
  - Continuous weight telemetry detects fraud or missed scans.
  - QR/barcode scanning speeds up basket building and creates a digital track of every item.
  - NFC-triggered checkout lets staff supervise payment without fixed POS kiosks.
  - Deployment guides for on-prem, DigitalOcean, Render, and Windows accelerate rollout.

```

**Key pipelines**
- **Weight telemetry**: ESP32 pushes readings every 10 seconds to `/weight`, backend validates and persists, frontend polls `/logs` every 3 seconds.
- **NFC checkout**: ESP32 posts NFC UID events to `/nfc`; frontend polls `/nfc?unprocessed=true` and prompts checkout flows.
- **Scanning flows**: Browser-based QR and barcode scanners translate optical scans into cart mutations, optionally validating weight deltas against the live sensor feed.

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/` | React + TypeScript smart cart interface. Includes UI components, scanner hooks, contexts, and localized copy. |
| `server/` | Express-based HTTPS API for ESP32 devices and the frontend. Handles weight data, NFC events, logging, and retention. |
| `sketch_oct19a/` | Arduino/ESP-IDF firmware examples (HX711 readings, HTTPS client). |
| `docs*.md` files | Focused runbooks: deployment, QR/barcode guides, architecture summaries, troubleshooting, etc. |
| `public/`, `dist/` | Static assets and build outputs. |
| `render.yaml`, `render deployment docs` | Infrastructure-as-code for Render deployment. |

---

## 4. Hardware & Firmware Layer

- **Microcontroller Platform**: ESP32/ESP8266 (Wi-Fi enabled).
- **Sensors**: HX711 load cell amplifier + load cell to capture cart weight.
- **Firmware Capabilities** (see `sketch_oct19a` and README):
  - Wi-Fi credential storage with auto-reconnect.
  - HTTPS client configured for the weight server (self-signed cert support during dev).
  - JSON payload format: `{ "weight": <float>, "deviceId": "<optional-id>" }`.
  - Transmission interval: defaults to 10 seconds; configurable.
  - Serial logging plus retry backoff for resilience.
  - NFC event capture (UID + event type) for checkout workflows.
- **Security**: TLS-enabled communication using generated certificates (scripts provided under `server/generate-certs*.js|ps1`).

**Strong points**
- Works with inexpensive hardware, reducing capex.
- Modular firmware code makes it easy to add sensors (temperature, movement) or fine-tune intervals.
- Uses HTTPS even on-device, raising IoT security baseline beyond many hobby projects.

## 5. Weight Server (Node.js, `server/server.js`)

### Core Responsibilities
- **Ingestion**: `/weight` endpoint accepts POSTed readings, enforces numeric validation, range checks (0–1000 kg), and precision rounding.
- **Persistence**: `server/logger.js` appends readings to JSON storage (`server/data/weight-data.json`) capped at 10,000 entries; also writes daily log files (`server/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.log`).
- **Monitoring APIs**:
  - `GET /logs?limit=n`: most recent readings for UI polling.
  - `GET /stats`: aggregated metrics (count, min, max, average, latest).
  - `GET /status`: health check with uptime, environment, logging stats.
  - `GET /log-files`: discover available log archives.
- **NFC Event Handling**:
  - `POST /nfc`: ingest event with UID, timestamp, and mark as unprocessed.
  - `GET /nfc`: poll recent or unprocessed events.
  - `POST /nfc/mark-processed`: lifecycles events once the frontend confirms checkout.
- **Ops & Security**:
  - Helmet, CORS with allowlist, express-rate-limit (tuned higher for real-time mode), and request logging via Morgan + custom Logger.
  - Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM.
  - Dual-mode launch: HTTPS locally (self-signed certs) or HTTP behind platform TLS (Render/DigitalOcean) controlled by `USE_HTTPS`.
  - Log retention with automatic cleanup.

### Deployment Readiness
- Scripts for certificate generation (Node and PowerShell versions).
- `render.yaml` and `DEPLOYMENT*.md` cover Render and DigitalOcean automation.
- `production-start.sh` for process manager integration (e.g., PM2, systemd).

**Strong points**
- Lightweight but production-minded Express stack: rate limiting, logging, TLS, retention.
- NFC workflow stored in-memory for fast access, yet trivial to swap to Redis if scaling is needed.
- Extensive documentation, checklists, and troubleshooting guides reduce ops toil.

## 6. Frontend Application (React + Vite in `src/`)

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite.
- **UI Kit**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS (configured via `tailwind.config.ts`), lucide-react icons.
- **State & Data**:
  - React Contexts for cart (`src/contexts/CartContext.tsx`) and i18n (`src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`).
  - TanStack Query for asynchronous data (wrapped in `App.tsx`).
  - Custom hooks for weight polling, NFC detection, QR/barcode scanning.

### Primary Experience (`src/pages/Shopping.tsx`)
- **Product Catalog**: 21 curated SKUs (`src/data/products.ts`) with category filters and image assets.
- **Cart Panel**: `CartView` summarises items, quantity adjustments, totals, and weight estimates.
- **Scanner Launcher**: `ScannerPlaceholder` surfaces barcode + QR entry points as buttons.
- **Weight Display**: `WeightDisplay` card fixed bottom-right showing live sensor weight (polls `/logs` every 3 seconds) and optional cart-estimated weight.
- **NFC Checkout Dialog**: `NFCCheckoutDialog` orchestrates tap-to-pay confirmation, success/failure states, and automatic cart clearing.
- **Internationalization**: Language toggle (EN/AR) sets RTL or LTR layout, adjusts copy, and keeps UI accessible to bilingual shoppers.

### QR & Barcode Ecosystem
- **QRScanner (`src/components/QRScanner.tsx`)**:
  - Uses `html5-qrcode` to stream camera input (10 FPS).
  - Auto-selects back camera when available.
  - Parses QR payloads through `parseQRCodeData` and maps to products via `qrDataToProduct`.
  - Optional weight validation: compares encoded expected weight with live sensor reading via `useESP32Weight`.
  - Audible feedback and auto-close on success; error handling for invalid codes.
- **BarcodeScanner (`src/components/BarcodeScanner.tsx`)**:
  - Built with ZXing’s `BrowserMultiFormatReader`.
  - Multi-format support: EAN-13, UPC-A, Code-128, etc.
  - Duplicate prevention and cooldown to avoid double scans.
  - Plays success beep, closes automatically, and returns structured scan metadata.
- **Scanner Hooks**:
  - `useQRScanner` and `useBarcodeScanner` encapsulate open/close state, scan handlers, toast notifications (`sonner`), and cart integration.

### NFC Integration (`src/hooks/useNFCDetection.ts`)
- Polls `/nfc?unprocessed=true&limit=1` every second.
- Dedupes events using timestamp tracking (`lastProcessedTimestamp`).
- Exposes `markAsProcessed` to close the loop once checkout completes or cancels.
- Seamlessly plugs into `Shopping.tsx` to trigger dialogs only when the cart has items.

### Design Details
- **Responsive Layout**: Tailwind breakpoints ensure comfortable usage on tablets/devices attached to carts.
- **Accessibility**: Button labels, icons with text, and toasts provide confirmation loops for customers.
- **Offline/Failure Handling**: WeightDisplay toggles Live/Offline badges, includes retry button, and surfaces error messages.

**Strong points**
- Full-featured retail UI in a single page: browsing, scanning, carting, offers, maps, and checkout.
- Modular hooks/components allow re-use in kiosk or cashier dashboards.
- Multi-language support and RTL toggling built-in.
- UX-first touches (status badges, toasts, success/failure dialogs) deliver polished feel.

## 7. Data & Validation Flow

| Stage | Source | Validation | Storage/Usage |
|-------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Weight telemetry | ESP32 JSON POST | Range check, precision rounding (`validateWeightData`) | JSON store + daily log file; stats computed on demand |
| NFC events | ESP32 POST | UID required, event type optional | In-memory queue, polled by frontend; processed flag toggled via POST |
| QR payload | Scanned QR string | Parsed via `parseQRCodeData`; handles JSON/text fallbacks | Converted to product + optional weight validation before cart addition |
| Barcode payload | ZXing result | Duplicate scan cooldown, optional product lookup | Mapped to catalog item via barcode; adds to cart |
| Cart state | React Context | Quantity updates remove <=0 items; weight sum derived for comparison | In-memory; persisted per session only (could be extended) |

**Telemetry strengths**
- Layered validation prevents corrupted or out-of-range sensor data from skewing stats.
- Stats endpoint offers min/max/average for dashboards without extra tooling.
- Daily log rotation with retention keeps observability manageable.

## 8. Operational Workflows

### Development
1. **Server**: `cd server && npm install && npm run generate-certs && npm run dev`.
2. **Frontend**: `npm install && npm run dev` (default port 8080).
3. **ESP32**: Flash firmware with Wi-Fi credentials and server endpoint (localhost IP + 5050).
4. **Testing**:
   - Use the `test-server.js` utility to simulate weight payloads.
   - Scan sample barcodes from `BARCODE_SAMPLES.md`.
   - Monitor logs via `view-logs.js` or tail the JSON store.

### Production Deployment
- **Render**: `render.yaml` + `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` environment variable; HTTPS terminated by platform.
- **DigitalOcean**: Guides for droplet provisioning, firewall setup, and process supervision.
- **Windows**: `WINDOWS_SETUP.md` includes PowerShell scripts for certificates and service management.
- **Monitoring**: `/status` endpoint is suitable for uptime probes; logs integrate with external collectors if desired.

### Troubleshooting Resources
- `TROUBLESHOOTING_CONNECTION.md` for ESP32 ↔ server issues.
- `REALTIME_MODE.md` for tuning polling intervals and rate limits.
- Separate guides for QR and barcode deployment/testing ensure team members can validate each feature independently.
