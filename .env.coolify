# NOTES FOR COOLIFY
# ===================
# 1. In Coolify, you can deploy this as:
#    - Option A: Docker Compose (recommended) - uses docker-compose.yml
#    - Option B: Separate services - deploy frontend and backend individually
#
# 2. If deploying separately:
#    - Backend: Point to ./server folder, use server/Dockerfile
#    - Frontend: Point to root folder, use Dockerfile
#
# 3. Make sure to:
#    - Set up proper domains for both services
#    - Enable HTTPS through Coolify's SSL settings
#    - Configure ALLOWED_ORIGINS to match your frontend domain
