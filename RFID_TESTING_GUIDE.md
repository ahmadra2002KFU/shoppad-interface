## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### ESP32 Serial Monitor
```
// Enable verbose logging
#define DEBUG_MODE 1

// Check for these messages:
✅ "RFID RC522 initialized successfully"
✅ "NFC CARD DETECTED!"
✅ "NFC event sent to server"

// Watch for errors:
❌ "RFID RC522 initialization failed!"
❌ "Failed to send NFC event"
❌ "WiFi not connected"
```

### Server Logs
```bash
# Start server with verbose logging
npm run dev

# Watch for:
✅ "NFC event received"
✅ "Event marked as processed"

# Check for errors:
❌ "Invalid NFC data format"
❌ "Event not found"
```

### Browser Console
```javascript
// Check for NFC events
console.log('NFC detected:', event);

// Verify API calls
// Network tab → Filter by "nfc"
// Should see:
// GET /nfc?unprocessed=true&limit=1
// POST /nfc/mark-processed
```
